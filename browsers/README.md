# üßà Butter Browsers

A simple multi-browser installer for Debian-based Linux systems.

> **Note:** This script installs browsers from their official sources rather than potentially outdated Debian repositories.

## Features
- Installs multiple browsers with a single command
- Checks if browsers are already installed
- Adds necessary repositories and GPG keys automatically
- Uses AppImage for Zen Browser (no root required)
- Clean integration with your desktop environment

## Requirements
- Debian-based operating system
- wget and curl for downloading files
- sudo privileges for most installations

## Installation
To set up Butter Browsers:
```bash
# Download the script
wget -O install_browsers.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/repository/main/install_browsers.sh

# Make executable
chmod +x install_browsers.sh

# Run the script
./install_browsers.sh
```

## Usage
```bash
# Run the script and select browsers
./install_browsers.sh

# Install specific browsers by number
# Example: Install Firefox (1) and Brave (3)
./install_browsers.sh
# Then enter: 1 3
```

## Supported Browsers
1. **Firefox** - Latest from Mozilla APT repository
2. **LibreWolf** - Privacy-focused Firefox fork
3. **Brave** - Privacy-focused Chromium browser
4. **Floorp** - Customizable Firefox-based browser
5. **Vivaldi** - Feature-rich Chromium browser
6. **Zen Browser** - Tranquil, distraction-free browsing (AppImage)
7. **Chromium** - Open-source base of Chrome
8. **Ungoogled Chromium** - Chromium without Google integration

## How It Works
The script:
1. Presents a menu of available browsers
2. Lets you select one or multiple browsers
3. Adds necessary repositories and keys
4. Installs each selected browser
5. Creates desktop entries for easy access
