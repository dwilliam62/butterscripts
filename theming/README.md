# ðŸŽ¨ Butter Theming
A simple theming installer for Linux systems.
> **Note:** These scripts install GTK themes, icon packs, and Nerd Fonts on Debian-based systems.

## Features
- Installs Orchis GTK theme and Colloid icon theme with a single command
- Installs popular Nerd Fonts for enhanced terminal and editor experience
- Custom configuration automatically applied
- Clean installation process with status indicators

## Requirements

- wget/unzip for font installation

## Installation
To install the themes and fonts:
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/drewgrif/butterscripts.git

cd butterscripts/theming
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x install-theme.sh nerdfonts.sh
