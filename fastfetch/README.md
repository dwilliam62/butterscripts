# ðŸ§ˆ Butter Fastfetch

A simple Fastfetch installer and configurator for Linux systems.

> **Note:** The setup process will ask for confirmation before installation and will automatically configure shell aliases for bash, zsh, and fish.

## Features
- Installs and configures Fastfetch with a single command
- Works with Bash, Zsh, Fish, and other shells
- Multiple configuration options with pre-configured themes
- Automatic shell alias configuration
- Clean building process from source

## Requirements
- Linux-based operating system
- git for cloning repositories
- cmake for building Fastfetch
- sudo privileges for installation

## Installation
To set up Butter Fastfetch:
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/drewgrif/butterscripts.git

# Navigate to fastfetch directory
cd butterscripts/fastfetch

# Make executable
chmod +x butterff.sh

# Run the installer
./butterff.sh
```

## Usage
```bash
# Run fastfetch with default configuration
ff

# Run fastfetch with minimal configuration
fastfetch -c ~/.config/fastfetch/minimal.jsonc

# Run fastfetch with server configuration
fastfetch -c ~/.config/fastfetch/server.jsonc
```

## How It Works
The script:
1. Checks if Fastfetch is already installed
2. Builds Fastfetch from source if needed
3. Sets up configuration files in ~/.config/fastfetch/
4. Creates shell aliases for convenient usage
5. Provides multiple theme options for different use cases
